# Liwu
Liwu.ch is a site that I started when I was in college. The main purpose of the site was to share notes and documents.Â After thinking, I thought about building a full plateform with forum, blogging and advice.
I used Drupal 7 at the time. I had to modify views, templates and create a new theme for the site.
The site was never finished because I received some complaints from the professors that would not want their courses content and name on the web...

The files that are uploaded are the templates, css and js
